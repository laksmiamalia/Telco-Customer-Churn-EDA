This my first attempt on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as part of weekly assignment for **Dibimbing Data Science Class Batch 16**. Here, I used Telco Customer Churn dataframe from kaggle. [click here for the data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). <br>

## Goals for the Project:
1. Find what is the most affected customer to **churn** and can it be predicted? <br>
2. Find what is most favorable services or add-ons customers prefer? <br>
3. How long customers usually stayed with the company? <br>

## Used Library:
Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib and Seaborn
