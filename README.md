In this repository, we will do Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA and find the best models. There are four different models :

1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. KNN
4. Logistic Regression

From those four models, we compared the accuracy rate, to define the best model. The highest accuracy value of the model, mean the model is the best pick for dataset.

## Goals for the Project:
**Exploratory Data Analysis** <br>
1. Find out the insights for each features
2. Find out what affected customer to **Churn** the most.
3. Find out the relationship between each features with **Churn**

**Machine Learning** <br>
1. Find out what is the best models for this dataset
